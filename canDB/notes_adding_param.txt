Adding a parameter

in directory:
../svn_common/trunk/db

1. PARAM_LIST_INSERT.sql (function type)
  Easiest is to copy a line for this function type
  a. Add parameter name: unique
  b. Add description: unique
  c. Update sequence numbers

2. PARAM_VAL_INSERT.sql (values for functioni instance)
   a.  Copy the added lines above and past into this .sql.
   b.  Add the function name (instance) as 1st column item.
   c.  Delete and add to make the other items like the other lines.
   d.  Add the sequence numbers in the description field for a check
   e.  Don't forget to update to --
	INSERT INTO PARAM_VAL

3. Update app program struct
   e.g.
   ../svn_sensor/sensor/yogurt/trunk/yogurt_idx_v_struct.h
 
4. Update app program struct versus index
   e.g.
   ../svn_sensor/sensor/yogurt/trunk/yogurt_idx_v_struct.c

  These entries MUST be in the same sequence as the PARAM_LIST (and
    PARAM_VAL tables.  This is a table of pointers to the entries in 
    the struct, and the struct entries may have gaps due to the ALIGN
    of structs of structs.  The list of pointers, however, must match
    the database table list, and this array of pointers does not have
    any gaps.

5.  Update the debugging printout subroutine
   e.g.
   ../svn_sensor/sensor/yogurt/trunk/idx_v_struct_print.c
   As a debugging/check it prints out the struct values after initialization with the
   table value.

6.  Run updatej (full rebuild of tables)

7.  After running 'updatej', to update just the values
    run 'updatev'
